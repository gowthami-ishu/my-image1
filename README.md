From this process, I learned how to correctly write and debug a Dockerfile, ensuring that all necessary files, such as app.py, are properly copied into the container. I also understood the importance of checking for syntax errors, correct indentation, and avoiding hidden characters when working with Docker.Additionally, I learned how to build and run Docker images, set environment variables using -e, and map ports using -p. Troubleshooting errors like missing files and incorrect commands helped improve my debugging skills. Overall, this experience strengthened my understanding of Docker containerization, deployment, and best practices for structuring applications.
